    <h2>Note:</h2>
    <p>It's important to remember that this course isn't about completely learning a programming language or becoming an expert on any one part of coding.</p>
    <p>It's an introduction and overview to many different topics that you would use if you continued your coding studies.</p>
    <p>It is normal and expected to not remember everything we cover in class.</p>
    <p>The important part is that you have been exposed to these concepts and can build on them in the future!</p>
